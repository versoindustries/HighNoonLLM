Commercial License for HighNoon LLM Model Weights
The HighNoon LLM project, leveraging Hierarchical Spatial Neural Memory (HSMN), offers its model weights under a dual licensing model to support both community access and commercial applications. This document outlines the process for obtaining a commercial license for the use of HighNoon LLM model weights in profit-generating activities.
Overview

Code License: The source code for HighNoon LLM is freely available under the Apache 2.0 License, permitting use, modification, and distribution for both non-commercial and commercial purposes.
Non-Commercial Weights License: Model weights are available for non-commercial use (e.g., research, academic, or personal projects) under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.
Commercial Weights License: For commercial use of the model weights (e.g., in products, services, or revenue-generating applications), a paid commercial license is required. This document provides preliminary information and instructions for obtaining such a license.

Commercial Use Definition
Commercial use includes, but is not limited to:

Deploying HighNoon LLM model weights in software, applications, or services that generate revenue.
Using the model weights for consulting, training, or other paid services.
Integrating the model weights into commercial products, such as SaaS platforms, APIs, or enterprise solutions.
Any use in a for-profit organization’s operations, even if not directly monetized.

If your use case falls under these categories, you must obtain a commercial license.
Commercial License Terms
The commercial license for HighNoon LLM model weights is offered on a case-by-case basis, with terms tailored to the scale and nature of your use. Below is a general framework for the license, subject to negotiation:
1. License Scope

Non-Exclusive License: Grants the licensee the right to use the model weights for commercial purposes, as specified in the agreement.
Permitted Uses: Includes deployment in production environments, integration into products, and use in revenue-generating services.
Restrictions:
Redistribution of the model weights is prohibited without explicit permission.
Reverse-engineering or modifying the weights to circumvent licensing terms is not allowed.
Use in applications that violate applicable laws or ethical standards is prohibited.



2. Pricing

Flexible Pricing Model: License fees are determined based on factors such as:
Size of the organization (e.g., startup, SME, enterprise).
Scope of use (e.g., single application, enterprise-wide deployment).
Revenue generated from the application using the model weights.


Payment Structure: Options include one-time fees, annual subscriptions, or revenue-sharing agreements, to be finalized during negotiation.
Volume Discounts: Available for large-scale or multi-year licenses.

3. Support and Updates

Access to Updates: Commercial licensees receive priority access to new model checkpoints and updates (e.g., intermediate checkpoints in July and August 2025, final weights in September 2025).
Technical Support: Optional support packages include:
Integration assistance for deploying HighNoon LLM in your environment.
Optimization guidance for specific use cases (e.g., reducing latency, fine-tuning).
Dedicated support for troubleshooting and performance tuning.


Custom Services: Available services include fine-tuning the model for domain-specific tasks or consulting on AI strategy.

4. Duration and Renewal

License Term: Typically one year, with options for renewal.
Termination: The license may be terminated for non-compliance with terms (e.g., unauthorized redistribution). Termination clauses will be detailed in the final agreement.

5. Warranties and Liability

As-Is Basis: The model weights are provided “as is,” with no warranties regarding performance, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose.
Limitation of Liability: The licensor is not liable for direct, indirect, or consequential damages arising from the use of the model weights, except as required by law.
