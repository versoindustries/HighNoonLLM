# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as contributors and maintainers of the **HighNoon LLM** project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We aim to foster an environment of mutual respect, collaboration, and innovation to advance the development of the Hierarchical Spatial Neural Memory (HSMN) model.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Providing and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, or personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information (e.g., physical or email addresses) without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

- Remove, edit, or reject contributions (e.g., comments, code, issues, PRs) that violate this Code of Conduct.
